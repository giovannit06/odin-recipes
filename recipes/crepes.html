<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Crepes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide
    variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. 
    The breakfast staple dates back to at least 13th-century France.
</p>
<p>
    You can fill and top your crepes with whatever you like!
    Popular choices include whipped cream, fresh fruit, fruit sauce,
    cream cheese, and chocolate-hazelnut spread (Nutella).

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>
        Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl;
        gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine.
        Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat a ligthly oiled frying pan over medium-high heat.
        Pour the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe.
        Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats 
        the surface evenly.

    <li>
        Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the 
        bottom has turned ligth brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula
        around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crepe;
        flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown,
        about 1 minute more. Serve hot.
